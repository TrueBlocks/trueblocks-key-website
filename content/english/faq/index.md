## What is TrueBlocks Key?

TrueBlocks Key provides TrueBlocks Core's unique indexing through a cloud-based Web 2.0 API.

## What is TrueBlocks Core?

TrueBlocks Core is a 100% local, fully-open source, EVM-compatible indexing solution
that optimizes for account indexing. It then distributes the index as a public good
through the Unchained Index smart contract. It's also light-weight, making it possible
to run on consumer-grade hardware.

## I thought TrueBlocks was anti-Web 2.0. What's up?

We were never *anti-* anything. We're rabbidly *pro*-decentralization. For years,
we've been saying, "build the hard part first." We've done that. It's called TrueBlocks
Core. Now, we're building the easy part (TrueBlocks Key).

## Is TrueBlocks shifting its focus away from decentralization?

No, we remain as committed to decentralization as ever. The introduction
of TrueBlocks Key allows us to provide users with an alternative way to access
our unique index. Core remains at the heart of our commitment.

## Is Key Decentralized?

No.

## Is Core Decentralized?

Yes.

## How Can You Do Both At The Same Time?

TrueBlocks Core is continually building the index. It then periodically distributs the index
using IPFS. Key is created along-side this process by notifying an AWS "listener" of each
new record. Core is the primary way the system works. Key is for "side-show" and is provided
for your convenience.

## Why TrueBlocks Key?

We're making it easier for users/developers to access TrueBlocks' unique index. Plus,
we'll be honest -- it's time to monetize.

## When and Where TrueBlocks Key?

TrueBlocks Key is available now in early beta. You may use it through the [QuickNodes Marketplace](https://www.quicknode.com/?via=trueblocks) as an add-on.

## What is Unique about TrueBlocks Core?

TrueBlocks Core (also called The Unchained Index) is optimized for address-based
queries on consumer-grade hardware. This creates a number of unique qualities:

- Core produces a complete, reconciliable history of activity for any address.
- Core runs locally against a locall-running node, making it fully trustless.
- Core is small, which means it runs on consumer-grade hardware.
- Core is scalable because it distributes its data among all users through pinning-by-default.
- Core is private because it runs locally on your own hardware.
- Core is very fast because there's zero rate limiting.
