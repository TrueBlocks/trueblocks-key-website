## What is TrueBlocks Key?

TrueBlocks Key provides TrueBlocks Core's unique indexing through an AWS-based Web 2.0 API.

## What is TrueBlocks Core?

TrueBlocks Core is a 100% local-first, fully-open source, EVM-compatible, Web 3.0
native blockchain indexing solution that includes an account-optimized index
distributed for the public good through Unchained Index, and decentralized data
access via consumer-grade hardware.

## I thought TrueBlocks was anti-Web 2.0. What's up?

We were never <i>anti-</i> anything. For years, we've been saying that one
should build the hard part (i.e. the decentralized part) first. We've done that.
It's called TrueBlocks Core. Now, we're building the easy part.

## Is TrueBlocks shifting its focus away from decentralization?

No, TrueBlocks remains as committed to decentralization as ever. The introduction
of TrueBlocks Key allows us to provide users with another way to access our unique
index. TrueBlocks Core, with its 100% local-first and decentralized nature, remains
at the heart of our commitment.

## Is Key Decentralized / Is Core Decentralized?

No / Yes.

## How Can You Do Both At The Same Time?

TrueBlocks Core runs on your own computer building the index which is then distributed using IPFS.
Key uses the same index, but stored in a centralized location. Core will always be the primary way
the system works. Key is for convenience.

## Why TrueBlocks Key?

We're making it easier for users/developers to access TrueBlocks' unique index who up
until now could access via only TrueBlocks Core/Unchained Index which are strictly Web 3.0.

## When and Where TrueBlocks Key?

Coming soon and initially available through QuickNodes Marketplace as an add-on.

## What is Unique about TrueBlocks Core/Unchained Index?

The Unchained Index is optimized for address-based queries on consumer-grade
hardware. (In this sense, it's NOT a block explorer--it's an account explorer.)
This comes with a number of unique qualities:
- it can produce a complete, reconciliable history of activity for any address
- it runs locally against a locall-running node, there it provides trustless access to the data
- it's small which means it runs on consumer-grade hardware
- it's scalable because when it runs as designed it distributes its data among all users
- it's private because it runs locally
- it's very fast because rate limiting is not needed (since each user has his/her own copy)
