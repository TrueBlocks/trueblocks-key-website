TrueBlocks Key provides TrueBlocks Core's unique indexing through an AWS-based Web 2.0 APIs. Currently we only offer Appearances Index API (other APIs coming soon), which allows users to get a complete historical list of appearances (block number, transaction id) for any Ethereum address.

This includes appearances found in regular transactions, internal transactions, token transfers, withdrawals, mining rewards, etc. We find up to significantly more appearances than other sources.

TrueBlocks Key uses the index of appearances created by <a href="https://trueblocks.io">TrueBlocks Core</a>, which publishes the index as a public good through the Unchained Index smart contract. Unlike Key, Core is fully local and open source. Both are designed to work with any EVM-based blockchain. TrueBlocks Key provides a simple, easy-to-use (for pay) Web 2.0 interface to this index.

TrueBlocks Key is making it easier for users/developers to access TrueBlocks' unique index who up until now could access via only TrueBlocks Core/Unchained Index which are strictly Web 3.0.
